# Assignment 0
This is a simple assignment and it's main purposes are:
  * Getting you introduced to the test framework and testing it
  * Making sure by now all of you can implement simple class properties
  * Being able to tie your GitHub accounts to your real identities - all the repositories are private and this will only be used at the end of the grading process (for Assignment 1, Assignment 2 and the final Project).
